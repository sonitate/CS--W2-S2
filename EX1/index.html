    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the world of code! Last year, millions of learners from our
      community started with HTML. Why? HTML is
      <strong>skeleton of all web pages</strong>. It's often the first language
      learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end
      development work
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as
      <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/images">images</a>, text, or <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/videos">videos</a>.
